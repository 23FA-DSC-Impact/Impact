## Project Objectives
### Mission statement
Given that the stock market is a huge indicator of economic circumstances and situations, and has the power to drastically change an individual’s financial assets, our dataset and models will serve to help understand which types of data analysis/machine learning processes best predict stock market trends. Assuming accuracy, the model will help forecast economic events and allow companies to protect themselves in case of an oncoming financial risk. Furthermore, by using multiple types of models, we will understand which machine learning techniques are best suited for economic prediction, and dive deep into the framework of each model to analyze each model’s methodology.

### In a nutshell...
We aims to analyze performance of different forecast AI models using S&P 500 index over a decade.

## Dataset
Our data can be found at [S&P 500 Stocks on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/sp-500-stocks).
This is a publicly available dataset that is updated on a daily basis. Since this dataset is not yet complete, we can divide it up for training and test accuracy on more recent dates.

We are also utilizing an additional dataset last updated two years ago for [financial information of Fortune 500 companies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paytonfisher/sp-500-companies-with-financial-information).

## Approach
We will implement multiple Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to predict/forecast a S&P 500 index at arbitrary point of future(most likely 1 day and 1 month).

Then, we will analyze the models statistically and numerically by their performance(accuracy) depending on hyperparameters, resulting in the best prediction model.
